# Daily sprint tasker

Simple application to keep your tasks on track and have them ready for the daily huddle.
A heavy "work on progress" at the moment, but could be useful soon.

Todos / Ideas general
- [x] Store logic
- [x] Create tasks
- [x] Delete tasks
- [ ] Edit tasks
- [x] Start new sprint (and move existing springs accordingly)
- [ ] TBD: move unfinished tasks on new sprint TO the new sprint
- [x] Report overview
- [x] Current tasks overview
- [ ] CRUD challenges
- [ ] Archive page for older tasks

Different Tasklist behaviour:
- [ ] No "done" for Backlog / upcoming tasks (or with fastmove to current sprint)
- [ ] Speed Buttons for Backlog tasks "Move to current task" / "Move to upcoming task"
- [ ] Speed Button for Upcoming tasks "Move to current task"

Laravel / Backend part
- [ ] Lol, everything dudes! But as soon as this one is comming, the todos will be listed in a repository on its own.
